## SHOPME APP

ShopMe is an e-commerce application that connects to DummyJson Api to get random products and allows a user to add the product to their Cart or save the product to their favorite products. 
The user also gets to purchase the product, this is made possible by the Daraja Mpesa SDK.
This application is a work in progress and I intend to connect it to the Mpesa Daraja Api to allow product purchase.
